“Transparent AI: Building a Model Card for Your Machine‑Learning Project”

## Learning Objectives

- Regulatory awareness – Understand the EU AI Act’s transparency obligations for high‑risk AI systems.
- Documentation skills – Learn how to communicate model purpose, data provenance, performance, and risk in a concise, structured format.
- Critical evaluation – Identify potential biases, safety concerns, and mitigation strategies for a given AI system.
- Ethical reasoning – Reflect on societal impact and accountability measures.

## Context

The EU AI Act classifies many AI systems as “high‑risk” and requires providers to supply clear, accessible documentation—often called a model card—that explains what the system does, how it was built, its limitations, and how it should be used responsibly. In this assignment you will create such a document for a machine‑learning model you develop (or an existing open‑source model) and demonstrate how it satisfies the Act’s transparency provisions.

## Deliverables

- Model Card	Structured documentation covering all required sections.	PDF or Markdown (≈ 2–4 pages).
- Reflection Essay	Short essay (≈ 300‑500 words) discussing how the model card addresses EU AI Act transparency clauses and what gaps remain.	
- Code Repo	Link to a public repository (GitHub/GitLab) containing the model code, data preprocessing scripts, and a README 

## Assessment criteria

- Completeness (25%): All sections filled, regulatory references included
- Correctness (25%): Correct description of data, model, metrics; reproducible numbers
- Critical Analysis (25%): Insightful discussion of risks, bias, mitigation
- Reflection (25%): Connection to EU AI Act, personal learning take‑aways
